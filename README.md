For when somebody wants to screen share in light mode and your eyes starts bleeding.
You are on your dark setup of sweetness, enjoying your dim light office, coffee is great,
you join a meeting with some org randos, they want to screenshare. Holy shit, the
light mode of death hits your eyes like a flashbang, instantly blinding your special
snowflake eyeballs for the next 20 minutes.

If only you had UnBlindMe, the veil of darkness which can be layered over whatever screensharing nightmare
you are currently experiencing, and at your will you can go from 10% opacity to 100% opacity.
